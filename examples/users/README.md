Example of users.list
=====================

Simple application that demonstrates how Slack can be queried for a list of users

Running
=======

Rename `reference.conf.template` and provide the `app.token` configuration variable.

This is easiest done by getting your test token directly from [Slack]((https://api.slack.com/docs/oauth-test-tokens)).

Then just run `sbt run` from console.
